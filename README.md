## TODOMATIC fullstack app

## DONE

1. cloned todo-react todomatic from mdn.github.io/todo-react using https
1. modified so I followed step-by-step instructions in MDN web site
1. Added an express server to develop fullstack app
1. When I tried so nest a repository inside a new repository using git init the warning was about creating a submodule for the cases when you depend on an external respository in your own repository but you want them to be independent just when updates/upgrades become available.
1. So I am not going to try it. I am to fork the project into my account, try to update with the the code I edited (or merge), add the expres/mongo repository in one folder, and then maybe create  the submodule.

git rm --cached todo-react to untrack the todo-react orignal and then to clone my own todo-react-todomatic here

1. done
1. Now the question is to start a todomatic from scratch separately or use the latest version and delete everything and start, as I already did. Problem being that if I decide to sync with mdn.react-todo is not going to work. So keep my forked todomatic in sync and start other project from scractch or add it as a module so they can be independent.
1.  I need a good react-todo to test the todo-express. So, I need full react version to work on express, meaning I have to add api actions, which are not going to be merged with mdn original. To solve this, I will keep a mdn original, a todomatic that I am going to modify but never do a pull request since I am not fixing issues, just adding integration with express/mongo server. 
1. also, to prepare express from scratch, and to present an alternative of using postman, I need a fully integrated todo-react.
1. Once I start quarter on react, I will create a new todo-react from scratch, and the todo-react-todomatic is just a module, and the new todo-react from scratch will be part of the repository todo-apps project. Which will include different versions of todo list: vanilla javascript, html, jquery and others.

## PLAN

1. Start with express one file everything and go from there.
1. Continue with react one file and go from there.

## STEPS
1. created github repository: todo-shopping-list-apps; public; added .gitignore VisualStudio template; license GNU General Public License v3.0; cloned to my-local-repository, first at get2laptop
